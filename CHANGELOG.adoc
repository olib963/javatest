** log the times of tests

* Ability to contain a test suite within another suite
* Ability to prefix `MatcherAssertion` descriptions with custom messaging.

=== Changed

* Allow override of `JavaFire` `testRunners` property at commandline level
* Documentation is now generated by asciidoctor and snippits are generated from tests
* Extracted `onTestCompletion` and `onRunCompletion` to their own separate functional interfaces
* Altered eventual consistency defaults to be quicker and more reasonable
* `TestSuite` interface to `TestSuiteClass`
* Handle suite results and single test results separately
* `TestResults` aggregation - split logs for the run into their own list.
