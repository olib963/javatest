= Eventual Consistency

Sometimes you will need to write an assertion that you cannot guarantee will hold straight away. You can use the `Eventually`
static imports to write tests that will eventually hold.

[source, java]
----
import static io.github.olib963.javatest.JavaTest.test;
import static io.github.olib963.javatest.JavaTest.that;
import static io.github.olib963.javatest.eventually.Eventually.eventually;

public class EventualTest {

    public static Test eventualTest(ExecutorService executor) {
        return test("Map is populated", () -> {
            var map = new HashMap<String, String>();
            // You can imagine this is some asynchronous task in your code base.
            executor.submit(() -> {
                // Due to this 1 second sleep the assertion will not hold straight away.
                try { Thread.sleep(1000L); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                map.put("foo", "bar");
            });
            return eventually(() ->
                    that("bar".equals(map.get("foo")), "Map contains entry foo:bar"));
        });
    }
}

The `eventually` function will by default wait 100 milliseconds between each attempt and will attempt to run your assertion 20 times.
You can pass an instance of `EventualConfig` to the `eventually` function to customise the behaviour:

[source, java]
----
import static io.github.olib963.javatest.JavaTest.that;
import static io.github.olib963.javatest.eventually.Eventually.eventually;

public class MyCustomEventualAssertions {
    // Configuration of 3 attempts, waiting 2 seconds between each with an initial delay of 3 seconds.
    private EventualConfig myConfig = EventualConfig.of(3, Duration.ofSeconds(2), Duration.ofSeconds(3));

    private Assertion attempt20TimesAndWait100Millis = eventually(this::assertion);

    private Assertion attemptUsingCustomConfig = eventually(this::assertion, myConfig);

    private Assertion attemptUsingCustomConfigNoDelay = eventually(this::assertion, myConfig.withNoInitialDelay());

    private Assertion attemptUsingCustomConfigWithOverrides =
            eventually(this::assertion, myConfig.withAttempts(10).withWaitInterval(Duration.ofMillis(50)));

    // Simple assertion just used to demonstrate how to call the eventually function
    private Assertion assertion() {
        return that(true, "This should pass");
    }
}
