= Eventual Consistency

Sometimes you will need to write an assertion that you cannot guarantee will hold straight away. You can use the `Eventually`
static imports to write tests that will eventually hold.

[source, java]

include::../src/test/java/io/github/olib963/javatest/eventually/documentation/EventualTest.java[tags=content]
----

The `eventually` function will by default wait 100 milliseconds between each attempt and will attempt to run your assertion 20 times.
You can pass an instance of `EventualConfig` to the `eventually` function to customise the behaviour:
