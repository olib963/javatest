= JUnit Runner

It is simple to run JUnit tests as part of your JavaTest run by using the `JUnitRunner`. This runner makes use of
the https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#launcher-api[programmatic launcher API] to run JUnit tests. You
create any arbitrary `LauncherDiscoveryRequest` to call out to JUnit and there is a convenience method
that exists for just running all tests in a package.
