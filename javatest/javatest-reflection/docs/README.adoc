= Reflection Runner

A runner that will recursively walk a given collection of test source directories (or directory) using the given classloader
to load any instance of:

- `TestSuiteClass` with a *public zero argument constructor*. All of which are run in a single test runner
- `TestRunners` with a *public zero argument constructor* flattened into the underlying ``TestRunner``s it returns.

You can filter on the class names of the `TestSuiteClass` or `TestRunners`.
