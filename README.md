# JavaTest

Experimental attempt at a different style of test framework.

## Basic Principles

- Each test should return one assertion.
- Tests should be written in plain functional Java with no magic. (I may add some magic reflection at a later date if it helps breaking tests apart, but only if it is needed.)
 
## Wishlist

- Pending assertion to allow the filling in of tests at a later point in time.
- Functional composition of tests etc.
- Context aware test logging.
- Matchers
- Dependant assertions
